                ☛ HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages.<br><br>
                ☛ It describes the structure of a web page and consists of a series of elements that tell the browser how to display content.<br><br>
                ☛ CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML.<br><br>
                ☛ CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed and allows for separation of content and design.<br><br>
                ☛ Using HTML, you can create headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other web page elements.<br><br>
                ☛ CSS can control the layout, color, font, and overall visual appearance of the web page.<br><br>
                ☛ Both HTML and CSS are cornerstone technologies that are essential for web development.<br><br>
                ☛ They work together to create visually appealing and well-structured web pages.<br><br>
                ☛ HTML elements include tags like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, and many others.<br><br>
                ☛ CSS is applied to HTML using selectors and declarations, where selectors specify which HTML elements to style and declarations define the styles to be applied.<br><br>
                ☛ There are various ways to include CSS in HTML, such as inline styles, internal stylesheets, and external stylesheets.<br><br>
                ☛ Responsive web design, which ensures web pages look good on all devices, is largely achieved through CSS.<br><br>
                ☛ Modern web development often involves using frameworks and libraries that build on top of HTML and CSS, such as Bootstrap for CSS and React for JavaScript.
                <br><br> ☛ Learning HTML and CSS is the first step for anyone interested in web development.
                <br><br> ☛ Mastery of these technologies opens up the ability to create static websites, design visually appealing web pages, and build the foundation for more complex web applications.
                <br><br> ☛ The continued evolution of HTML and CSS includes new standards and features that enhance web development capabilities.
